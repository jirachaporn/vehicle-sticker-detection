# Automated Vehicle Tagging System (AVTS)

Automated Vehicle Tagging System for **vehicle parking authorization** that combines license plate recognition (OCR) and sticker detection.  
It uses **AI for Thai OCR**, **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Storage), and **Cloudinary** to manage images, models, and detection logs.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLO models.
- OCR via AI for Thai to read license plates.
- Cloud storage for detected images using Cloudinary.
- Database and file storage management with Supabase.
- Multi-location and model management (each parking location can have its own model).
- FastAPI backend with RESTful APIs for detection, logging, and statistics.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Supabase Python client
- Cloudinary Python client
- Ultralytics YOLO (for detection)
- OpenCV (for video/image processing)
